# Airplanes Risk Analysis for Business Expansion

## Overview
Company is expanding into the aviation industry and needs to identify low-risk aircraft for commercial and private operations. An analysis of the aviation accidents and incidents is therefore required to be analyzed to provide key insights to help in decision making for aircraft purchasing

---

## Business Problem
Expansion to new business segment can make the company struggle to identify Low-Risk Aircraft. This lack of insight can result in ineffective purchases, wasted resources and lost opportunities.

---

## Objectives
- To gain knowledge on the potential risks of different aircraft.
- To identify Low-Risk Aircraft for new Aviation Business.
- To provide actionable insights for decision making on purchasing aircraft.

---

## Research Questions
- What are the potential risks trends for the different types of aircraft?
- Which factors influence the identification of Low-Risk Aircraft?
- Can we predict future aircraft purchasing behavior based on historical data?

---

## Methodology
- Data Collection: Gather historical aviation data.
- Data Cleaning: Preprocess the data to handle missing values and duplicates.
- Feature Engineering: Create relevant features for analysis and modeling.
- Interpretation: Analyze the results and derive actionable insights.

---

## Success Criteria
- Recommendations that lead to a measurable low-risk aircraft purchasing through making data driven decisions.

---

## Data Understanding
The dataset used in this analysis comes from the **National Transportation Safety Board**, containing aviation accident and selecetd incidents in the United States and international waters data from 1962 to 2023. The dataset includes attributes such as:
- Aircraft damage
- Aircraft make and model
- Purpose of flight
- Injuries
- Weather conditions

## Data Modeling
- Feature Engineering for analyzing or modeling the data

---

## Evaluation
Risk analysis include:

- Aircraft Damage: Destroyed aircraft pose higher risks.
- Purpose of Flight: Commercial flights showed lower risks compared to personal flights.
- Weather Conditions: Adverse weather significantly increases risks
- Modern aircraft consistently demonstrate lower risks.

---

## Conclusion
- Data-driven insights support effective purchasing decisions.
- There was assumption that data may contain biases that need acknowledgement during analysis
- Important factors influencing decisions include aircraft damage, weather conditions and injuries.
- Focus on safety, compliance, and operational reliability.
- Future modeling can refine purchasing behavior.
